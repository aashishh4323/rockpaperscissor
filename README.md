# ✊✋✌️ Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a fun and interactive **Rock Paper Scissors** game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
It's my second mini-project and helped me practice DOM manipulation, basic game logic, and styling.

## 🎮 Features
- Clickable emoji buttons for Rock (✊), Paper (✋), and Scissors (✌️)
- Random computer choice
- Displays result of each round (Win, Lose, or Draw)
- Clean and dark UI with circular buttons
- Fully responsive layout

## 💻 Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, transitions, circular buttons)
- Vanilla JavaScript (event handling, random logic)

## 📚 What I Learned
- DOM selection and event handling (`querySelectorAll`, `addEventListener`)
- Game logic implementation
- Styling with CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Button design using `border-radius: 50%`
- Creating interactive UI elements

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aashishh4323/rockpaperscissor.git
